### Linear Models
- Assumes linear relationship between input variables(features) and the target(outpput)

in simple term, A linear model predicts outpput as a weighted sum of inputs

Prediction = (a x feature1) + (b x feature2) + (c x features3) + ... + bias

\(\^{Y}=b_{0}+b_{1}X_{1}+b_{2}X_{2}+\dots +b_{p}X_{p}\)
